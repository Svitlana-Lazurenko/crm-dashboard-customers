# Markup of the "Customers" page for the CRM "Dashboard"

## The project used:

- Cross-browser (modern normalize, autoprefixer, reset of styles), semantic markup.
- Preprocessor SCSS and BEM methodology.
- Pixel Perfect markup.
- Adaptive-responsive markup with a mobile version.
- Animations of the appearance of elements with the JavaScript library Anime.js

The markup was done without using frameworks.

### Note:

Compilation CSS from SCSS was created using the plugin for VSCode "Live Sass Compiler" and with
autoprefix settings: ["> 1%", "last 2 versions"]
